# Regression

## 1. Introduction to Regression

Regression is a type of supervised learning in machine learning that aims to find the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to predict continuous numerical values, such as the price of a house or the number of sales for a particular product.

In regression analysis, the independent variables are also called predictors or features, while the dependent variable is the target variable or response variable. The goal of regression is to build a model that can accurately predict the target variable based on the values of the predictors.

There are several types of regression models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression. In linear regression, the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable(s) is assumed to be linear, which means that the model can be represented by a straight line. In polynomial regression, the relationship is assumed to be non-linear and can be represented by a polynomial function. In logistic regression, the target variable is binary (e.g., 0 or 1) and the model predicts the probability of the target variable being in one of the two classes.


Overall, regression is a powerful tool for predicting numerical values, and is used in a wide range of applications, from finance and economics to healthcare and social sciences.

<font color=gray size=1><center>Map Projection - AL2O3(WT%)</center></font>

When you see the following instruction:

```python
Do you want to continue to project a new element in the World Map?
1 - Yes
2 - No
(Plot) ➜ @Number: 2
```

You can choose “Yes” to map another element or choose “No” to exit map mode. Here, we choose 2 to skip this step.

### 2.3 Enter the range of data and check the output

After quitting the map projection mode, you will see the input format from command prompt:

```python
Select the data range you want to process.
Input format:
Format 1: "[**, **]; **; [**, **]", such as "[1, 3]; 7; [10, 13]" --> you want to deal with the columns 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13
Format 2: "xx", such as "7" --> you want to deal with the columns 7
@input: [10,13]
```

Here, we use “[10, 13]” as an example. The values of the elements we choose would be shown on the screen.

```python
--------------------

### 2.4 Use imputation techniques to deal with the missing values

Below is a brief summary of missing values, you may choose the proper imputation technique to deal with them:

```python
-*-*- Imputation -*-*-
Check which column has null values:
--------------------
AL2O3(WT%)    False
CR2O3(WT%)     True
FEOT(WT%)     False
CAO(WT%)      False
dtype: bool
--------------------
The ratio of the null values in each column:
--------------------
CR2O3(WT%)    0.100917
AL2O3(WT%)    0.000000
FEOT(WT%)     0.000000
CAO(WT%)      0.000000
dtype: float64
--------------------
Note: you'd better use imputation techniques to deal with the missing values.
(Press Enter key to move forward.)
```

```python
-*-*- Missing Values Process -*-*-
Do you want to deal with the missing values?
1 - Yes
2 - No
(Data) ➜ @Number: 1
```
Here, let's choose 1 to deal with the missing values.

```python
-*-*- Strategy for Missing Values -*-*-
1 - Drop Rows with Missing Values
2 - Impute Missing Values
Notice: Drop the rows with missing values may lead to a significant loss of data if too many
features are chosen.
Which strategy do you want to apply?
(Data) ➜ @Number:1
```
We'll just skip the lines with missing info to keep things simple.

### 2.5 Feature Engineering

Next, you can choose “Yes” for feature engineering option to construct a new feature and select a dataset in the former we choose, or No to exit Feature Engineering mode:

```python
-*-*- Feature Engineering -*-*-
The Selected Data Set:
--------------------
Index - Column Name
1 - AL2O3(WT%)
2 - CR2O3(WT%)
3 - FEOT(WT%)
4 - CAO(WT%)
--------------------
Feature Engineering Option:
1 - Yes
2 - No
(Data) ➜ @Number: 1
```

After enter “1”, we now is ready to name the constructed feature and build the formula. In this example, we use “newFeature” as the name and we build the formula with “b*c+d”:

```python
Selected data set:
a - AL2O3(WT%)
b - CR2O3(WT%)
c - FEOT(WT%)
d - CAO(WT%)
Name the constructed feature (column name), like 'NEW-COMPOUND':
@input: new Feature
```
```python
Build up new feature with the combination of basic arithmatic operators, including '+', '-', '*', '/', '()'.
Input example 1: a * b - c
--> Step 1: Multiply a column with b column;
--> Step 2: Subtract c from the result of Step 1;
Input example 2: (d + 5 * f) / g
--> Step 1: Multiply 5 with f;
--> Step 2: Plus d column with the result of Step 1;
--> Step 3: Divide the result of Step 1 by g;
Input example 3: pow(a, b) + c * d
--> Step 1: Raise the base a to the power of the exponent b;
--> Step 2: Multiply the value of c by the value of d;
--> Step 3: Add the result of Step 1 to the result of Step 2;
Input example 4: log(a)/b - c
--> Step 1: Take the logarithm of the value a;
--> Step 2: Divide the result of Step 1 by the value of b;
--> Step 3: Subtract the value of c from the result of Step 2;
You can use mean(x) to calculate the average value.
@input: b*c+d
```

This step, we enter b*c+d. And the output is as below:

```python

After this, you may choose to process feature scaling on X Set or not:

```python
-*-*- Feature Scaling on X Set -*-*-
1 - Yes
2 - No
(Data) ➜ @Number: 2
```

In this doc, we choose 2, and for the next step of feature selection, we also choose option 2.

```python
-*-*- Feature Selection on X set -*-*-
1 - Yes
2 - No
(Data) ➜ @Number:2
```


The next step is to split the data into a training set and a test set. The test set will be used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model that will be trained on the training set. In this example, we set 20% of the data to be set aside as the test set. This means that 80% of the data will be used as the training set. The data split is important to prevent overfitting of the model on the training data and to ensure that the model's performance can be generalized to new, unseen data:

```python
-*-*- Data Split - Train Set and Test Set -*-*-
Note: Normally, set 20% of the dataset aside as test set, such as 0.2
(Data) ➜ @Test Ratio: 0.2
```

After checking the output, you should be able to see a menu to choose a machine learning model for your data, in this example, we are going to use “7 - Extra-Trees”.

```python
-*-*- Model Selection -*-*-
1 - Linear Regression
2 - Polynomial Regression
3 - K-Nearest Neighbors
4 - Support Vector Machine
5 - Decision Tree
6 - Random Forest
7 - Extra-Trees
8 - Gradient Boosting
9 - XGBoost
10 - Multi-layer Perceptron
11 - Lasso Regression
12 - Elastic Net
13 - SGD Regression
14 - BayesianRidge Regression
15 - All models above to be trained
Which model do you want to apply?(Enter the Corresponding Number)
(Model) ➜ @Number:7
```

We have already set up an automated learning program. You can simply choose option '1' to easily access it.

```python
Do you want to employ automated machine learning with respect
to this algorithm?(Enter the Corresponding Number):
1 - Yes
2 - No
(Model) ➜ @Number:1
```


```python
