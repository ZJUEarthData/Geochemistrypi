# Classification

Classification is a supervised learning task, in which the training data we feed to the algorithm includes the desired labels. The aim of classification task is to classify each data into the corresponding class. So we have to use dataset with known labels to train a classification model. Then choose one model which has best performance to predict unknown data.

## 1. Train-Test Data Preparation
**Choose the mode you need to use.**

```
-*-*- Mode Options -*-*-
1 - Regression
2 - Classification
3 - Clustering
4 - Dimensional Reduction

```

Before we start the classfication model training, we have to specify our X and Y data set. in the example of our selected data set, we take column [2,9] as our X set and column 1 as Y. 

**Select X data**
```
The selected X data set:
Select the data range you want to process.
Input format:
Format 1: "[**, **]; **; [**, **]", such as "[1, 3]; 7; [10, 13]" --> you want to deal with the columns 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13
Format 2: "xx", such as "7" --> you want to deal with the columns 7
@input: [2,9]
```

Select the data range you want to process.

Then we have to split our data set in to training data and testing data, we can simply spedcify the spliting ratio in the command line:

**Split the data**

    -*-*- Data Split - Train Set and Test Set -*-*-
    Note: Normally, set 20% of the dataset aside as test set, such as 0.2
    (Data) ➜ @Test Ratio: 0.2


## 2. Model Selection

Since the traing and testing data are ready now, we can selelt a model to start our classification. Geochemistrypi provide users with 5 classification models. Here we use xgboost as an example.

    -*-*- Model Selection -*-*-:
    1 - Logistic Regression
    2 - Support Vector Machine
    3 - Decision Tree
    4 - Random Forest
    5 - Xgboost
    6 - All models above to be trained
    Which model do you want to apply?(Enter the Corresponding Number)
    (Model) ➜ @Number: 5 
    (Press Enter key to move forward.)

Gechemistrypi integrated the autoML library for its machine learning tasks, so we can simply choose to employ automated machine learning with respect to this algorithm.

    Do you want to employ automated machine learning with respect to this algorithm?(Enter the Corresponding Number):
    1 - Yes
    2 - No
    (Model) ➜ @Number: 1

## 3. Results

    *-**-* Xgboost is running ... *-**-*
    Expected Functionality:
    +  Model Score
    +  Confusion Matrix
    +  Cross Validation
    +  Model Prediction
    +  Model Persistence
    +  Feature Importance
    ...

The programm will implement cross validation during the training with k-Folds=10. Finally, the confusion matrix, feature importance map plot, feature weights Histograms will be saved under output/images/modle_output folder. In the meantime, trained xgboost model will be saved under the output/trained_models folder.
