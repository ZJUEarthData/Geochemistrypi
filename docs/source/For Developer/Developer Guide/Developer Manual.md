## 1. Installation <a name="installation"> </a>

Requirements: Python 3.9
**Note**:You must have Python 3.9 installed on your computer to use the software.

### 1.1 Check Environment

You need to ensure that pip is installed.
You can view it by typing instructions on the command line.

```
$ pip --version
```
**Note**: **\$** refers to the command line interface. Don't copy **\$**.  The same as below.

### 1.2 Quick Install

One instruction to download our software on command line, such as Terminal on macOS, CMD on Windows.

```
$ pip install geochemistrypi
```

The beta version runs on MacOS, Windows or Linux. Make sure that your network is stable while downloading.

### 1.3 Advanced Install

It is highly recommended downloading in an isolated virtual python environment, which prevents messing up your system python packages.

**Step 1:** Create an virtual environment

```
$ python -m venv my_virtual_environment_name
```

Note: The only element to change is ***my_virtual_environment_name***. (You need to remember the name of your virtual environment so you can use it next time.)
If ***python*** fails, try with ***python3***.

The instruction above will create an virtual environment on the current directory.

**Step 2:** Activate the virtual environment

(1) Operating System: macOS or Linux

In the same directory, run this instruction:

```
$ source my_virtual_environment_name/bin/activate
```

(2) Operating System: Windows

In the same directory, run this instruction:

```
$ my_virtual_environment_name\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**Step 3:** Download our software

```
$ python -m pip install geochemistrypi
```

Make sure that your network is stable while downloading.

In two methods, if you fail to download, please refer to part 4 \<bug report\> .



## 2. Example<a name="example"> </a>

**Beta version:** It only supports the command to apply data mining techniques to deal with your own data. More algorithms and their related functions will be appended to our software in the following released versions.

**How to run:** After successfully downloading, run this instruction on command line whatever directory it is. It will takes some time to load the software into your CPU and memory when the first time to run the software. Just be patient!!

**Case 1:** Run with built-in data set for testing

```
$ geochemistrypi data-mining
```

**Note**: There are four built-in data sets corresponding to four kinds of model pattern, regression, classification, clustering, decomposition.

**Case 2:** Run with your own data set

```
$ geochemistrypi data-mining --data your_own_data_set.xlsx
```

**Note**: Currently, only `.xlsx` file is supported. Please specify the path your data file exists. The only element to change is ***your_own_data_set.xlsx***.

 If you run the command above, it means the command is executed under the directory your data file exists. Related processed results will be in the same directory.

**Other Commands:**

```
$ geochemistrypi --help
```

It shows the related information of our software, including brief introduction and commands.

```
$ geochemistrypi --install-completion zsh

### 4.4 Select the data range you want to process
Here is about data selection.
Sometimes we do not need to process all of the data columns,just need to select the columns we want to process according to one input format,such as we need the column from the 8th to 13th,the input format is "[8,13]".

~~~
Select the data range you want to process.
Input format:
Format 1: "[**, **]; **; [**, **]", such as "[1, 3]; 7; [10, 13]" --> you want to deal with the columns 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13
Format 2: "xx", such as "7" --> you want to deal with the columns 7
