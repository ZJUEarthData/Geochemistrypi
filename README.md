Geochemistry π is an **open-sourced highly automated machine learning Python framework** dedicating to build up MLOps level 1 software product for data-driven geochemistry discovery on tabular data.

Core capabilities are:

+ **Continous Training**
+ **Machine Learning Lifecycle Management**

Key features are:
+ **Easy to use:** The automation of data mining process provides the users with simple number options to choose.
+ **Extensible:** It allows appending new algorithms through Scikit-learn with automatic hyper parameter searching by FLAML and Ray.
+ **Traceable**: It integrates MLflow to build special storage mechanism to streamline the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

Latest Update: follow up by clicking `Starred` and  `Watch` on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ZJUEarthData/geochemistrypi), then get email notifications of the newest features automatically.



## Quick Installation

One instruction to download on **command line**, such as Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt on Windows.
```
pip install geochemistrypi
```
One instruction to download on **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
```
!pip install geochemistrypi
```
**Note**: For more detail on installation, please refer to our online documentation in **Installation Manual** under the section of **FOR USER**. Over there, we highly recommend to use virtual environment (Conda) to avoid dependency version problems.


## Quick Update

One instruction to update the software to the latest version on **command line**, such as Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt on Windows.
```
pip install --upgrade geochemistrypi
```
One instruction to download on **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
```
!pip install --upgrade geochemistrypi
```
Check the latest version of our software:
```
geochemistrypi --version
```



## Example

**How to run:** After successfully downloading, run this instruction on **command line / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** whatever directory it is.

### Case 1: Run with built-in data set for testing

On command line:
```
geochemistrypi data-mining
```
On Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:
```
!geochemistrypi data-mining
```
**Note**: There are four built-in data sets corresponding to four kinds of model pattern.

### Case 2: Run with your own data set

On command line:
```
geochemistrypi data-mining --data your_own_data_set.xlsx
```
On Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:
```
!geochemistrypi data-mining --data your_own_data_set.xlsx
```
**Note**: Currently, only `.xlsx` file is supported. Please specify the path your data file exists. For Google Colab, don't forget to upload your dataset first.

### Case 3: Activate MLflow web interface

On command line:

```
geochemistrypi data-mining --mlflow
```

On Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:

```
!geochemistrypi data-mining --mlflow
```
**Note**: Once you run our software, there are two folders (`geopi_output` and `geopi_tracking`) generated automatically. Make sure the directory where you execute the above command should have the genereted file `geopi_tracking`.

Copy the address in the displayed result into any browser to open the MLflow web interface. The address is normally like this http://127.0.0.1:5000. Search MLflow online to see more operations and usages.

## Roadmap

### First Phase

It works as a **software application** with a command-line interface (CLI) to automate **data mining** process with frequently-used **machine learning algorithms** and **statistical analysis methods**, which would further lower the threshold for the geochemists.

The highlight is that through choosing **simple number options**, the users are able to implement a full cycle of data mining **without knowledge of** SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, FLAML, Ray packages.

The following figure is the activity diagram of automated ML pipeline in Geochemistry π:

<img src="https://github.com/ZJUEarthData/geochemistrypi/assets/47497750/544cbebc-fe5d-42d4-a0c1-cbe65067f3a5" />

Its data section provides feature engineering based on **arithmatic operation**. It allows the users to have a statistic analysis on the data set as well as on the imputation result, which is supported by the combination of **Monte Carlo simulation** and **hypothesis testing**.

Its models section provides both **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning** methods from **Scikit-learn** framework, including four types of algorithms, regression, classification, clustering, and dimensional reduction. Integrated with **FLAML** and **Ray** framework, it allows the users to run AutoML easily, fastly and cost-effectively on the built-in supervised learning algorithms in our framework.

### Second Phase

Currently, we are building three access ways to provide more user-friendly service, including **web portal**, **CLI package** and **API**. It allows the user to perform **continuous training** by automating the ML pipeline and **machine learning lifecycle management** by unique storage mechanism in different access layers.
