## Quick Installation

One instruction to download on **command line**, such as Terminal on macOS, Power Shell on Windows.
```
pip install geochemistrypi
```
One instruction to download on **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
```
!pip install geochemistrypi
```
Check the latest version of our software:
```
geochemistrypi --version
```
**Note**: For more detail on installation, please refer to our online documentation in **Installation Manual** under the section of **FOR USER**. Over there, we highly recommend to use virtual environment (Conda) to avoid dependency version problems.


## Quick Update

One instruction to update the software to the latest version on **command line**, such as Terminal on macOS, Power Shell on Windows.
```
pip install --upgrade geochemistrypi
```
One instruction to download on **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
```
!pip install --upgrade geochemistrypi
```
Check the latest version of our software:
```
geochemistrypi --version
```



## Example

**How to run:** After successfully downloading, run this instruction on **command line / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** whatever directory it is.

### Case 1: Run with built-in data set for testing

On command line:
```
geochemistrypi data-mining
```
On Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:
```
!geochemistrypi data-mining
```
**Note**: There are four built-in data sets corresponding to four kinds of model pattern.

### Case 2: Run with your own data set without model inference

On command line:
```
geochemistrypi data-mining --data your_own_data_set.xlsx
```
On Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:
```
!geochemistrypi data-mining --data your_own_data_set.xlsx
```
**Note**: Currently, `.xlsx` and `.csv` files are supported. Please specify the path your data file exists. For Google Colab, don't forget to upload your dataset first.

### Case 3: Implement model inference on application data

On command line:

```
geochemistrypi data-mining --training your_own_training_data.xlsx --inference your_own_inference_data.xlsx
```

On Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:

```
!geochemistrypi data-mining --training your_own_training_data.xlsx --inference your_own_inference_data.xlsx
```
**Note**: Please make sure the column names (data schema) in both training data file and inference data file are the same. Because the operations you perform via our software on the training data will be record automatically and subsequently applied to the inference data in the same order.

The training data in our pipeline will be divided into the train set and test set used for training the ML model and evaluating the model's performance. The score includes two types. The first type is the scores from the prediction on the test set while the second type is cv scores from the cross validation on the train set.


### Case 4: Activate MLflow web interface

On command line:

```
geochemistrypi data-mining --mlflow
```

On Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:

```
!geochemistrypi data-mining --mlflow
```
**Note**: Once you run our software, there are two folders (`geopi_output` and `geopi_tracking`) generated automatically. Make sure the directory where you execute using the above command should have the genereted file `geopi_tracking`.

Copy the URL shown on the console into any browser to open the MLflow web interface. The URL is normally like this http://127.0.0.1:5000. Search MLflow online to see more operations and usages.

## Roadmap

### First Phase

It works as a **software application** with a command-line interface (CLI) to automate **data mining** process with frequently-used **machine learning algorithms** and **statistical analysis methods**, which would further lower the threshold for the geochemists.

The highlight is that through choosing **simple number options**, the users are able to implement a full cycle of data mining **without knowledge of** SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, FLAML, Ray packages.

The following figure is the activity diagram of automated ML pipeline in Geochemistry π:

<img src="https://github.com/ZJUEarthData/geochemistrypi/assets/47497750/b7f8e6bc-0c6c-4917-adfa-f00c6ccbad7b" />

Its data section provides feature engineering based on **arithmatic operation**. It allows the users to have a statistic analysis on the data set as well as on the imputation result, which is supported by the combination of **Monte Carlo simulation** and **hypothesis testing**.

Its models section provides both **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning** methods from **Scikit-learn** framework, including four types of algorithms, regression, classification, clustering, and dimensional reduction. Integrated with **FLAML** and **Ray** framework, it allows the users to run AutoML easily, fastly and cost-effectively on the built-in supervised learning algorithms in our framework.

</p>

### Second Phase

Currently, we are building three access ways to provide more user-friendly service, including **web portal**, **CLI package** and **API**. It allows the user to perform **continuous training** and **model inference** by automating the ML pipeline and **machine learning lifecycle management** by unique storage mechanism in different access layers.

The following figure is the system architecture diagram: <br>
